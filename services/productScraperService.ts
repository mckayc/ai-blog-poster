/**
 * NOTE: This is a placeholder for a real product data fetching implementation.
 * 
 * Why this is a placeholder:
 * Directly fetching and scraping website content (like an Amazon page) from a client-side
 * JavaScript application is not feasible or reliable due to:
 * 1.  CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) policies that browsers enforce, which block
 *     requests to different domains (e.g., your app to amazon.com).
 * 2.  Anti-scraping measures on sites like Amazon that can block or CAPTCHA your requests.
 * 
 * The robust solution is to use a server-side component (e.g., a Node.js backend,
 * a serverless function on AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, or Vercel) that can
 * make the request on behalf of the client. This backend would not have CORS issues
 * and can use more advanced libraries (like Puppeteer or Cheerio) and proxy services
 * to reliably scrape the data.
 * 
 * Another valid approach is to use the Amazon Product Advertising (PA) API, which
 * also requires a backend to securely store credentials and handle requests.
